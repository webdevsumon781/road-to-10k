                    Most of them wouldn’t know that I’m a <strong>6-figure football investor</strong> or that I started
                    my working life

                <p>
                    At my ripe old age of 55, I don’t have the time to go through my entire life story every time
                    someone questions me so I tend keep my answer short and simple.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my opinion, this is ALL it takes to become successful in this short life of ours:

                    Repeat these two concepts in your head over and over again as everything I will present to you from

                    People in betting circles call me <span class="creator">“The Creator”</span> since I’m pretty good

                    Adopted as a 2-year-old, I grew up with my foster parents in Worthing.

                    Never really got on with them... I think they were just putting up with me because of the money they

                    This is when reality <strong>slapped me</strong> in the <br> face for the first time - <strong>bills

                <p>
                    With no qualifications or experience, all I could get was a commission-only sales job working for a
                    half dodgy door to door marketing company.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Against all odds, I stuck with them for the next 20 years selling everything from double glazing to
                    insulation in the 80’s to broadband internet when it first came out in the late 90s.

                    <br>
                    I quickly climbed up the ladder in this pseudo-Ponzi scheme.

                    <br>
                    It was perfect for someone as young and ambitious as myself who wanted to get away from the boring
                    village life.

                    <br>
                    I graduated to a team leader, then a manager and had my own office in Liverpool with 72 sales reps
                    at the age of 32.

                    but hate the company you work for.
                    <br><br>
                    As a manager, I had to deal with very high employee turnover and grown adults that at times wouldn’t
                    have made enough money to pay their rent or feed their kids!
                    <br><br>
                    I would spend my earnings on nice suits and leased supercars to impress my subordinates whilst
                    having no house or savings to show for it.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="trust">AMBITION</span> kept pushing me but <span class="trust">I wasn’t being REAL to
                        myself</span>. We were all slaving around to make

                    <br><br>
                    My second job was as a junior chef at a 4-star restaurant in Portsmouth.
                    This is when I first got a taste of what it’s like to have a regular, decent income.
                    <br><br>
                    I stopped dreaming about hot women and mansions in Spain and became accustomed to that boring,
                    mainstream routine:

                    Day in, day out.
                    <br><br>
                    This went on for a good 7 years.
                    <br><br>
                    That feeling of wanting more in life was killing me though.
                    <br><br>
                    Yes, it was nice to be financially stable and get a mortgage and get married and have two lovely
                    kids but everytime I drove past the upscale £1 million apartments in Gunwharf Quays, I’d envy the
                    business-minded people who took a risk and became really wealthy.
                    <br><br>
                    The guys who didn’t let society stifle their ambition and took calculated steps to success
                    withstanding the numerous hurdles on the way.
                    <br><br>
                    Anyways, I quit my job as a chef and me and the wife used the money we saved up over the years to
                    take over a local pub in 2005.
                    We have been running it as a couple ever since.
                    <br><br>
                    It’s still independent and growing every year.

                    It just felt like betting is something I’d be really good at.
                    <br><br>
                    I could see the real potential of earning huge sums of money but at the same time, life taught me to
                    have patience and break things
                    down into small, achievable steps.

                    When I started off, I wasted a small fortune placing bets that never really had a chance of winning
                    and that I was placing on a whim rather than through any particular knowledge.
                    <br><br>
                    I even took a shine to the Goals Galore coupon, you know the one, pick 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 matches in
                    which you think both teams will score and win a few thousand pounds.

                    <br><br>
                    But, what <strong>REALLY</strong> is the likelihood of you selecting that many matches and them all
                    coming in?
                    Somebody once told me that it was at much greater odds than the bookies offer you anyway.
                    <br><br>
                    Anyway, there is always one that lets you down.

                    So I decided that rather than waste my cash any longer, I’d look into <b>realistic ways</b> that I
                    could
                    actually make a bit of
                    <br>
                    <span class="trust">extra money every week.</span>
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You see, if you adopt this attitude, the likelihood of success is much greater because you aren’t
                    chasing that dream and betting with emotion and you don’t place that 20 team accumulator and cross
                    your fingers!
                    <br> <br>
                    I wanted to devise a methodical method of eliminating the teams and fixtures that let me down week
                    in week out, and so I set about doing research. <b>Months and months of research at that!</b>
                    <br> <br>
                    I wanted to produce a formula that I could benefit from, and I’ll be honest, it hasn’t been easy,
                    but after taking my modest bank to <span class="trust">£50,000</span> last year, <b>I confidently
                        believe that I found the one.</b>
                    <br> <br>
                    I’m probably the only tipster online that combines everything (yes EVERYTHING) that points towards a
                    winning bet and places the bet.
                </p>
                <h2 class="secretTop">
                    By the end of my selection and elimination stage I have <span class="trust">TWO</span> teams that
                    have been <b>analysed,
                        crosschecked, scrutinized, tested, evaluated and re-analyzed</b> through dozens of filters.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That’s right, just 2 teams will be all that is required and there is no complicated formula for this
                    bet, you will be simply backing both teams to win in a simple accumulator.
                    <br><br>
                    I continue to use this 12-layer-filter method on a daily basis and I’ve made 3-4 figures every week.

                    We all start our betting careers with high hopes, which quickly diminish when we realise that
